    "\n",
    "2. **Accessing gradients**: After calling `loss.backward()`, PyTorch stores gradients in each parameter's `.grad` attribute:\n",
    "   - `model.fc1.weight.grad` â†’ gradient with respect to W0\n",
    "   - `model.fc1.bias.grad` â†’ gradient with respect to b0\n",
    "   - `model.fc2.weight.grad` â†’ gradient with respect to W1\n",
    "   - `model.fc2.bias.grad` â†’ gradient with respect to b1\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verification**: We manually computed the same gradients using NumPy (exactly like our previous implementation) and confirmed PyTorch's automatic gradients match perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The key insight**: PyTorch's `loss.backward()` performs the exact same chain rule calculations we coded manually:\n",
    "   - `dZ2 = A2 - y` (for BCE + Sigmoid)\n",
    "   - `dA1 = dZ2 @ W1.T`\n",
